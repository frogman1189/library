# Family Library System
Simple library system designed for home use.

Uses a barcode scanner to scan book barcodes and then grabs information about the book from google's book api and roughly relates the book to a database user. It is designed so that books do not need a secondary barcode to be stuck to them, however this prevents 100% accuracy as to which specific book is owned by each user. All the system can say is that a user owns x amount of "this" book, and another user has borrowed "x", however who's copy of "x" it is is uncertain.
